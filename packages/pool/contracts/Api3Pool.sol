/// @title API3 pool contract
/// @notice Users can stake API3 tokens at the pool contract to be granted
/// shares. These shares are exposed to the Aragon-based DAO with a MiniMe
/// token interface, giving the user voting power at the DAO. Staking pays out
/// weekly rewards that get unlocked after a year, and staked funds are used to
/// collateralize an insurance product that is outside the scope of this
/// contract.
/// @dev Functionalities of the contract are distributed to files that form a
/// chain of inheritance:
/// (1) Api3Pool.sol
/// (2) TimelockUtils.sol

/// (4) StakeUtils.sol
